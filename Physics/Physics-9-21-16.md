##Kinematics in one dimension (equations)

$\Delta x = x_f - x_i$  
$\Delta t = t_f - t_i$  
$avg V = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}$


##Exam 1 review examples

###Ex 1

A swimmer is doing laps in a swimming pool. The pool is $40$m across. The swimmer's position is denoted by the $x$ axis.  
The swimmer travels at the following speeds for each lap

| Lap | Speed |
| --- | ----- |
| 1   | 1 m/s |
| 2   | 2 m/s |
| 3   | 4 m/s |
| 4   | 8 m/s |

1. Draw the velocity-time graph.
2. What is the *total* displacement ($\Delta x$) after **4** laps?
3. What is the total amount of time they spent doing laps? (Total time interval)

a. I dunno how to draw a graph on here, so this is the best you get.  
b. Displacement is zero.  
c. 75s if not there and back, otherwise 150s


###Ex 2

You're driving on a moped in one direction. Per hour, you drive different speeds (represented in the table below)

| Hour | Speed   |
| ---- | ------- |
| 1    | 10 mi/h |
| 2    | 20 mi/h |
| 3    | 30 mi/h |

Make a position-time graph.
