##Mechanical Power

###Springs! ($\leftarrow$ with fake enthusiasm)

A box flies at a spring with a plate on the front. When the box hits the plate, it compresses the spring ann unknown amount $\Delta x$. What is the 

Spring Stiffness = $k$

**Hooke's Law**: $F = -k \Delta x$

$W = \Delta E_K = -\Delta E_P$  
Area underneath Force vs position graph =  
$\frac{1}{2} bh = \frac{1}{2} (\Delta x)(-k \Delta x)$  
$ = - \frac{1}{2} k \Delta x^2 = -\Delta E_P$  
$\Delta E_P = \frac{1}{2} k \Delta x^2$

###Ex. Car crashes into barrier

A car crashes into a foam barrier. How much does the foam barrier compress?

$v = 100 m/s$  
$m = 2000 kg$  
$k = 5 \times 10^6 N/m$  
$\Delta x = ?$

$W = \Delta E_K = -\Delta E_P$  
Area underneath Force vs Position graph =  
$W = \frac{1}{2} bh = \frac{1}{2} \Delta x(-(5.0 \times 10^6) \cdot \Delta x))$  
$100 = \frac{1}{2} \Delta x(-(5.0 \times 10^6) \cdot \Delta x))$  
$200 = \Delta x(-(5.0 \times 10^6) \cdot \Delta x))$


##Energy Forms

**Mechanical Power** = $\bar{P} = \frac{\Delta F}{\Delta t}$

###Ex. Horse pulls block of ice

A horse pulls a block of ice on top of ice (how is it running without slipping?)  ![???](http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/993/875/084.png)  
What is the power of the pull?

$\mu = 0$  
$m = 1000kg$
