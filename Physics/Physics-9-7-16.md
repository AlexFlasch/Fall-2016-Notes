##Nature of Physics & Units

###What is physics?
How forces produce motion.

You can break physics down into a grid

One axis being size, the other being speed:  
You have small and large things,  
and you have slow and fast tihngs

Small slow things are quantum mechanics  
Large slow things are general physics (this class)  
Large fast things are relativity
Small fast things are relativistic quantum mechanics
