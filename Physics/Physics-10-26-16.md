##Energy Conservation and Representations

A box is pushed across a low friction surface. The force on the box is 1N from 0 to 2 meters, 2N from 2 to 4 meters, and 3N from 4 to 6 meters.

$v_0 = 0$

What is the Work $W$? What about the Kinetic Energy $K_f$, and Final Velocity $V_f$

$W = W_{TOT} = \sum W_i = W_A + W_B + W_C$  
$ = \sum F_i \Delta X_i = W_i = (1N)(2m) + (2N)(2m) + (3N)(2m)$  
$ W_i = 12 N \cdot m = 12$ Joules $\leftarrow$ unit of energy  
$K_f = W = 12J$  
$K_f = \frac{1}{2} m \cdot v_f^2$  
$\frac{2K_f}{m} = v_f^2$  
$v_f^2 = \frac{2(12)}{6} = 4$  
$v_f^2 = \sqrt{4} = 2$ m/s


##Ex. Springs

**Hooke's Law**: When you change the length of a spring by a distance $\Delta x$, as $|\Delta x|$ increases, $|F|$ increases.

What is the velocity of the block at the neatural length of the spring?

$K_f = W = F_i \cdot \Delta x = \frac{1}{2} 6 \cdot 3 = 9$  
$K_f = \frac{1}{2}mv_f^2$  
$9 = \frac{1}{2}2 \cdot v_f^2$  
$\sqrt{9} = \sqrt{v_f^2}$  
$v_f = 3$ m/s

**spring constant**: The stiffness of a spring. Defined as $-\frac{\Delta F}{\Delta x}$ or $-\frac{F}{x}$


##Ex. Ball drop

A ball is dropped with a mass of 100kg, a weight of -980N

$W = \Delta K$  
$-mg(h_f - h_i) = \frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 - \frac{1}{2}mv_i^2$  
$-mg \cdot h_f + mg \cdot h_i = \frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 - \frac{1}{2}mv_i^2$  
$\frac{1}{2} mv_i^2 + mg \cdot h_i = \frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 + mg \cdot h_f$  

$K_i + U_i = K_f + U_f$  
Kinetic Energy + Potential Energy = Total Energy  
$(E_{TOT})_i = (E_{TOT})_f$
