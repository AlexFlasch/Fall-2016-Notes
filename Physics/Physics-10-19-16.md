##Uniform Circular Motion

###Steel bearing and insulation example

If a ball rolls within a circle, with a whole cut out of it (kind of like a C),
it will continue to travel in the direction it was moving it last touched a wall in the circle.


###Centripetal force

Centripetal force means "center seeking" in ancient Greek. So a force is applied towards the center from any direction.

$\frac{\vec{\Delta v}}{\Delta t} = \vec{a_c}$  
$|\vec{a_c}| = a_c = \frac{v^2}{R}$

$F_c = ma_c = \frac{mv^2}{R}$

####Ex. String Throw

A ball is attached to the end of a string. The string is attached to a point and is swung around this point. The circle has a radius of 2m. The string breaks and the ball is released. The plane of the circular motion is 10m in the air. The mass of the ball is 100kg. What is the tension force on the ball?

$F_c = ma_c$  

C: $T = m \cdot \frac{v^2}{R}$  

A: $x = v_xt$  

B: $ y = y_0 + v_{y0}t + \frac{1}{2} a_yt^2$  
$ = H + \frac{1}{2} \cdot gt^2 (g = 9.8m/s)$

$y = 0 \rightarrow \text{B} \rightarrow t = t_{fall} \rightarrow \text{A} \rightarrow v_x = v$

$0 = H - \frac{1}{2} \cdot gt^2$  
$ -H = \frac{1}{2} \cdot gt^2 \rightarrow t_{fall} = \sqrt{\frac{2H}{g}} = \sqrt{\frac{20}{9.8}} = 1.4s$

$x = v_xt \rightarrow R = v_xt_{fall}$  
$30 = v_x \cdot 1.4$  
$v_x = 21.5m/s$

$T = \frac{mv^2}{R} \rightarrow \frac{ 100kg \cdot 21.5m/s^2}{2m} = 2.3 \times 10^4 N$
