##Kinematics in one dimension (graphs)

1. Describe the motion in words:  

	* The motion is all forward, and moves at a variable pace hovering around a whole number the whole time.
	
2. How far does the bug travel *before* it stops?
	
	* The bug travels 40cm before the first stop.

3. Where does the bug stop at $t = 20s$?

	* The bug finishes at 60cm

*avg velocity* = $\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}$
