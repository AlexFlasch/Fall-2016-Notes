##Exam 2 review

Chapters to review:

* Basic probability
* Discrete probability
* Continuous probability

Undertsand Experiments, Outcomes, and Events

*experiment* is anything that involvs chance  
*outcome* is a possible thing that could occur as a result of an experiment  
*events* represent the outcomes of interest

Probability of rolling a fair six-sided die:  
$Pr(A) = \frac{\text{num outcomes in event A}}{\text{total outcomes}}$  

Probabilistic addition:

* intersection
* union
* mutually exclusive events
* complements of an event

$Pr(A \lor B) = Pr(A) + Pr(B) - Pr(A \land B)$

###Expected Value and Variance  
A discrete random variable has a location analogous to the average called the *expected value* often denoted $E(X)$

$E(X) = \sum\limits_{t=1}^T Pr(X = x_t)x_t$ where T is the number of events defined by the random variable

Variance is the dispersion in the probability of the possible outcomes

$V(X)$ of $X$ is $V(X) = \sum\limits_{t=1}^T Pr(X = x_t)[x_t - E(X)]^2$ where $T$ is the number of events defined by the random variable

###Binomial distribution

bionomial experiments must meet the following:

1. Each $n$ trials has two possible outcomes: success or failure
2. Probability of success is denoted by $\pi$ and stays the same across trials
3. Trials are identical
4. Trials are independent
5. Random variable counts the number of successes in the $n$ trials

We let $k$ denote teh number of successes occuring in the $n$ trials

Binomial probability: $Pr(X = k) = {n \choose k} \pi^k (1 - \pi)^{n-k}$

###Continuous probability

Continuous events are measured over intervals

###Normal Distribution

The standard normal is represented by the variable $Z$.

$Z \equiv \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}$

Z transformation:

1. Start with normal random variable X
2. Subtract off the mean of X
3. Divide by standard deviation of X

Solving normal probability problems

1. Draw picture of X dist and shade area attempting to cmpute
2. Apply Z transformation
3. Draw picture of Z dist and shade area you are trying to compute
4. Use standard normal...

Suppose X ~ N(5, 4); that is, the random variable X follows a normal distrubtion with mean $\mu = 5$ and standard deviation $\sigma = 4$. Compute $Pr(X > 9)$. To solve follow the four step method.
