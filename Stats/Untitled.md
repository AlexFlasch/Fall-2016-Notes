##Fitbit data
**Hypothesis**: I believe that the bedtime of students and the rank of the school they attend has an inverse(?) relationship. That is, as the rank goes towards 1, the bedtime of students attending those colleges gets later and later.

* As schools are ranke higher (closer to 1) The work load tends to increase, thus students spend more time doing classwork

##What is statistics?
**Fomrally**: Economic and business stats are a set of math-based tools that permit the dicision maker to summarize and use information relevant to the judgment calls required of econoimists and business professionals.

**Informally**: Stats is the process of seeking out, organizing, and distlilling information.

**What is information?**

* Hard numbers
* Beliefs
* Many more

Information is a synonym for _data_.

##Descriptive vs Inferential Statistics
**Descriptive Statistics**: Describes the data you observe.  
**Inferential Statistics**: Infer conclusions from your descriptions.

Know your limitations! Sometimes we can only describe data, not infer conclusions.

###Subdisciplines of Descriptive Statistics

* Tabular descriptive statistics
* Graphica descriptive statistics
* Numerical descriptive statistics

###Examples of Inferential Statistics

* Weather forecasting
* Movements in market demand
* Who will become president

To utilize statistical inference, identify the population you are interested in learning about, then gather a smaple from that population for studying.

##Population vs Sample
Who not just go for the whole population?

* Gathering data on an entire population can be too expensive.
* Gathering data can be a destructive process.
	* Nutrition analyses
* Observing the whole population may not be advisable.
	* Collecting market population data could mean ignoring another market 
* Small samples can give deep insight into a population.

##Quantitative vs Qualitative

* **Qualitative** data are observations of qualities.
	* THey are inherently words.
	* Example: A person's state of origin or political affiliation.
* Analysis with qualitative data is rather limited.
	* We cannot average qualitative data
* **Quantitative** data are observations of quantities
	* We are observing attributes measured with numbers (income, age, profits)
* Airthmetic operations are meaningful with quantitative data
* **Discrete** Quantitative data is data that measure how many.
	* How many pets a sample has.
* **Continuous** Quantitative data that measures how much.
	* Times in the 100-meter dash.

##Time Series vs Cross-Sectional

* All data also fall into Time Series or Cross-Sectional
* **Time Series data** are observed at a sequence of points in time
	* Stock prices
* **Cross-sectional data** are observed at the same time
	* No time component included
* **Panel Data** have both _time series_ and _cross-sectional_ components
 	* Industry profitability. Data would include
	 	* Mnay coporations (cross-sectional)
	 	* All observed over many years (time series)
