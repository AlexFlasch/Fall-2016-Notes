##Probabilistic Addition

###Experiments, Outcomes, and Events

An *experiment* is an activity that involves chance.  
Experiments must have well defined *outcomes*, a list of all the possible things that could occur as a result of the experiment.  
The *event* represents the outcomes of interest.  

The probability of an event *A* is simply:  
$Pr(A) = \frac{\text{# of outcomes}}{\text{total # of outcomes}}$

If our event of interest is $Pr(\text{face card})$, then:  
$Pr(A) = \frac{12}{52} = 0.23$


###Probabilistic Addition

A *joint event*, often called the *intersection*:  
Where $Pr(A \text{and} B)$ is the *joint probability* of occurance.

$Pr(A \land B) = \frac{\text{# of shared outcomes}}{\text{total # of outcomes}}$

A compound event is formally defined as the *union* of two or more individual events  
Example: Compute $Pr(\text{king} \lor \text{ace})$  
$ = \frac{4}{52} + \frac{4}{52}$  
$ = \frac{8}{52}$  
$ = \frac{2}{13}$  

joint: $A \cap B$  
union: $A \cup B$

The *complement* of an event is a set of all outcomes **not included** in the event itself.  
The probabilities of $A$ and $\lnot A$ must sum to one
